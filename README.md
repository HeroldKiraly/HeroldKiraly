### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Herold.
####  A little about myself, it all started in 2013 when I started a hobby to program video games, websites and smaller applications for personal use. I have tried many different kinds of career paths and just recently gained back the passion to focus on Front End Development full time. I find great enjoyment in taking ideas, conceptual designs, and converting them into pixel perfect functional user experiences.
